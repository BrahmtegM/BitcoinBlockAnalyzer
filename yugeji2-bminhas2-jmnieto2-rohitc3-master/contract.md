## Team Contract (yugeji2-bminhas2-jmnieto2-rohitc3)

### Communication
1. **Team Meetings** Our team will meet once a week every Saturday from 3-5 PM using discord. There will be no designated note taker, but all group members will contribute to notes. Notes will be stored on a shared Google document, time-stamped for each meeting.
2. **Assistance** Each team member can be contacted through email ({bminhas2, yugeji3, jmnieto2, rohitc3}@illinois.edu) or Discord. Outside of emergencies or other commitments, we commit to responding to emails within 48 hours.
3. **Respect** Design decisions can be accepted by simple majority - while unanimous agreement is preferred, it is not required. Each member of the team commits to adhering to the decisions made, even if they personally disagree with them.

### Collaboration
1. **Work Distribution** Each week, the necessary deliverables for the week will be determined by the full team and each member will volunteer to work on one or more deliverables. When no one volunteers, two team members will be randomly assigned the task
2. **Time Commitment** Each member is expected to work no less than 2 and no more than 6 hours per week on the project. If a deliverable ends up taking more time, the rest of the team should be pulled in to assist with the unforeseen complication.
3. **Conflict Resolution** Both sides will get a chance to present their arguments, and a majority vote among all team members will decide who is right.
